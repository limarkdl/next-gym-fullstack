## GYMSPARR - Detailed workout/progress logger

This is my pet project for practicing NextJS development. I'm using/going to use the following libraries and technologies: TypeScript, NextJS, React, TailWindCSS, ShadCN (UI), Prisma (ORM), Jest (Unit/Component Testing), Cypress (E2E), Clerk (Authentication), PostgreSQL (DB), etc. (may be extended) 

## Appearance / Design

Using formal and attractive ShadCN UI library and brand new font 'Unbounded' I have achieved beautiful and meaningful UI and UX.

## Goals

Get more experience with NextJS production-like development and build a reliable, beautiful and useful full-stack application. 
Use this application for my gym trainings and improve my health.
